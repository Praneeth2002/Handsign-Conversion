# Handsign-conversion
# Motivation
Hand gesture is one of the methods used in sign language for non-verbal communication. It is most commonly used by deaf & dumb people who have hearing or speech problems to communicate among themselves or with normal people. Various sign language systems have been developed by many makers around the world but they are neither flexible nor cost-effective for the end users. Hence in our project we have introduced software which presents a system prototype that is able to automatically recognize sign language to help deaf and dumb people to communicate more effectively with each other or normal people. Being a significant part in nonverbal communication hand gestures are playing key role in our daily life. Hand Gesture recognition system provides us an innovative, natural, user friendly way of communication with the computer which is more familiar to the human beings. By considering in mind the similarities of human hand shape with four fingers and one thumb, the software aims to present a real time system for recognition of hand gesture on basis of detection of some shape-based features like orientation, Centre of mass centroid, fingers status, and thumb in positions of raised or folded fingers of hand.
# Scope
The proposed hand recognition system is extremely useful as it can be used as human-computer interface as well as can help paralyzed people. In future devices can be easily controlled through the hand gesture movement easily. In previous concepts, the sensor techniques were used but, in this system, no any additional sensor is needed. It can be achieved by deep convolutional neural network algorithm. Deep learning deals with heavy data set, through which the learning process is done for our system.
# Design
We take the input from the user using camera (OpenCV module), input can be either a video or photo, after taking input the if it is a video, then it will be converted into a set of images, an over iterations of each image the model takes it as input and predicts the hand sign and itâ€™s respective alphabet and returns it.

# Results
We made a web portal on a personal computer from which we can invoke the generator software which require a camera for recording the gestures, our project converts the input gestures into letters, words and sentences then the sentences are further converted into audio files and spelled out through speakers of the device.
